# Attacks

## Passwords

### Dictionary

A dictionary of known or common words used for passwords is cycled through, checking if any of them are an accurate fit for the password.

Takes advantage of people choosing too simple of passwords.

### Credential Stuffing

When an attacker successfully acquires our login information for a particular service, they then use the same credentials on many other platforms.

Takes advantage of high likelihood of overuse of the same login information.
